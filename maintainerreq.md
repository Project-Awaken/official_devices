# To become an official maintainer for Project Awaken:

**Before you apply to add your device into our list of official devices, you should know a few things:**

1. You **MUST** own the device. Blind and untested builds aren't allowed. Unified, and devices with minimal hardware changes are also allowed to be maintained.

2. You must have basic git (cherry-pick, squash, etc) knowledge.

3. You must have a daily drivable **unofficial build released 2 weeks** before applying for official.

4. Kernel tree **MUST** be open source for us.

5. You **MUST** be on SELinux enforcing.

6.  Prebuilt kernels are only allowed **if your device does not have proper kernel sources**., You **MUSTN'T** ship a prebuilt kernel if you have working kernel sources available just because you save 5 minutes of build time.

7. Device Trees must be open source with proper commit history, this can be exempted in special causes such as proprietary code/prebuilts or the usage of private intellectual property provided you can provide me a proper reason for doing so. This exemption is not permanent, where you would be provided a window of up to 3 months at max depending on the issue.

8. You **MUST** meet all requirements as mentioned [here](requirements.md).

If all is well, you may apply [here](https://github.com/Project-Awaken/official_devices/issues/new/choose)
